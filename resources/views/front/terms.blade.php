			<br>
			<p><strong>7. Definition of Tailored Quote</strong></p>
			<p>7.1 When we provide service, in most cases we do not act as a broker or agent for any particular insurer, although we act as an introducer. We have provided you with links to other various companies and comparison websites, to find you the best possible deal so that you can use our website to have an instant quote from a provider of your own choice and buy online. If you are short on time and would like us to manually fill out any form according to your tailored specification and requirement, on your behalf we can work on finding you a Tailored Quote, as long as you authorise us and provide us with accurate information. Based on the details given, we can provide you with free no obligation Tailored Quotes from various companies. We can look into your current situation and the conditions you are currently residing in. With the given information we will manually search into a deeper field of scope, to find insurance suited to your lifestyle. Usually this is a more challenging premium which in turn will save you money and time. By the term Tailored Quote for any policy we mean you can have the policy tailored to your requirements. We cannot make any alterations to the insurance policy itself but we can endeavour to find the type of policy that fits your requirements. Tailored Quote includes our administration fee, interest and all other charges, but it does not include any charges from insurer or broker that may arise later on if you instruct any amendment or alteration to the policy after setting up, like change of car or change of address. When we work on Tailored Quote we always process your data and payment information according to Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>8. Price delivery</strong></p>
			<p>8.1 You should receive the results of your enquiry (Tailored Quote) within 24-48 hours by text (sms) to the mobile number provided and or by email. You will also be contacted by telephone to discuss where you will have the opportunity to learn more about the policy features. However, we are completely reliant on the availability of the third party sites and on the overall performance of the World Wide Web. At certain times Tailored Quotes are not available. You will be advised if this is the case and under these circumstances we will e-mail you to advise when your quote is ready.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>9. What will you have to pay us for our services?</strong></p>
			<p>9.1 Full details of any fees for amendments related to your policy that you directly pay to your insurer can be found in your policy documentation. Any other fees will be discussed or advised of before proceeding with the policy. We provide Tailored Quotes for free of charge but if you decide to buy any policy by using Tailored Quote or its reference, it may incur a separate administration fee. When you pay us any administration fee you only pay us for providing you with the Tailored Quote (only when you choose to buy the policy, if you do not buy any policy, it is free) but not for setting up the policy. A Tailored Quote always includes our administration fee in it. If you give us any false or inaccurate information, it may result in cancellation of your policy and our administration fee will not be refunded. We do not share the administration fee with any insurer and this is not linked with your insurance policy and is non-refundable at any time.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>10. What are your responsibilities?</strong></p>
			<p>10.1 You should answer all questions honestly, completely and to the best of your knowledge, and for ensuring that any assumptions made are correct. Failure to do so may lead to your insurance policy being invalid or an increase in premium by your insurer. You may also be liable for any third party costs in the event of an accident.</p>
			<p>10.2 It is important that you read the insurance company&#8217;s terms and conditions to check that you understand and agree with them. The insurance company&#8217;s terms and conditions are not the same as ours and they will be the terms you agree to when you accept a quotation.</p>
			<p>10.3 It is important that you read all insurance documents issued to you and ensure that you are aware of the cover, limits and other terms that apply. Failure to comply with the insurer&#8217;s terms and conditions could invalidate your policy.</p>
			<p>10.4 You should also check that all your details on the policy documents are correct, including any assumptions that may have been made on your behalf by the insurer. If the information supplied by you is not correct, it is your responsibility to notify the insurance company. Failure to inform the insurer of any errors or missing information could invalidate your policy. Where you provide information about any other individual (e.g. a named driver) you are confirming to us that you have their authority to do so.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>11. Events of accidents and Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE)</strong></p>
			<p>11.1 Any driver who has had any accidents (fault or non-fault) or claims (whether claim made or not) in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with CUE for the history of any accidents or claims recorded within the CUE database. The Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) is a central database of motor, home and personal injury/industrial illness incidents reported to insurance companies, which may or may not give rise to a claim.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>12. Claims &amp; Underwriting Exchange Register</strong></p>
			<p>12.1 Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database, run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help the insurer to check the information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When the insurer deals with your request for insurance, the insurer may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell the insurer about any incident (such as an accident or theft) regardless of blame and whether a claim has been made or not. When you tell the insurer about an incident, the insurer will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant registers. You can ask the insurer for more information about this.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>13. Motor convictions, fixed penalty or disqualification and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)</strong></p>
			<p>13.1 Any driver who has had any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with DVLA for the history of any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications recorded within the DVLA database. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the organisation of the UK Government responsible for maintaining a database of drivers and a database of vehicles in Great Britain.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>14. No claims bonus (NCB) / No claims discount (NCD)</strong></p>
			<p>14.1 Proof of No Claims Bonus (NCB) may be required if you take out a policy where a NCB has been applied. It is solely the client&#8217;s responsibility to provide the proof of NCB. This proof should be a renewal notice or letter from your previous Insurance Company, which shows the main driver as the policyholder and the NCB earned. A policy schedule is not a good form of proof and may not be accepted. This NCB can only be used on one policy at any one time, and must have been used on a policy within the last 24 months.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>15. Motor Insurance Database</strong></p>
			<p>15.1 Your motor insurance policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers&#8217; Information Centre (MIIC), sometimes it may take up to 7 days to get your policy details updated on the MID. You can also check information about your own vehicle at www.askmid.com. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver&#8217;s use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers&#8217; Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant car insurance policy information. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this from the insurer, or at www.miic.org.uk</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>16. Terms of risk and circumstances where the insurer is unable to provide a quote</strong></p>
			<p>16.1 All providers specialise in slightly different risks and they do not quote on risks that fall outside their target customers. The more &#8220;high risk&#8221; or &#8220;non-standard&#8221; your risk is classed as by them, the fewer prices you will receive. In some cases, it might not be possible for you obtain a quote at all over the internet. In such cases we may put you in contact with a specialist telephone provider who will approach the insurance underwriters direct and negotiate a special rate on your behalf.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p><strong>17. What to do if you have a complaint?</strong></p>
			<p>17.1 We set ourselves very high standards and do our utmost to maintain these high standards in everything we do. In rare situations where you may feel those standards have not been maintained we would like you to tell us as this is the only way we will be able to improve our service.</p>
